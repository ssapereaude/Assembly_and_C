Overview

This document details the conversion of an assembly language program into a functional state on a modern 64-bit Linux system. The assembly code is designed to perform basic input/output operations and simple arithmetic (addition).

Original Code Description

The provided assembly program (project.asm) operates by performing the following steps:

Displaying a prompt to the user.
Reading a numeric input.
Displaying the same prompt again.
Reading another numeric input.
Adding the two numbers.
Displaying the result.
Exiting the program.
Changes Made During Conversion

Register Conventions and Syscall Adjustments
The original code was partially set up for 32-bit operations, evident in the use of registers like rbx, which are not used for passing parameters in 64-bit Linux syscalls. The conversion process involved:

Updating register usage to comply with the System V AMD64 ABI, which is standard for 64-bit Linux. This includes using rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, and r9 for passing syscall parameters.
Adjusting syscall numbers to their 64-bit values and ensuring correct usage of the syscall instruction.
Data Section Initialization
The .bss and .data sections were adjusted:

Ensuring correct memory reservations for num1, num2, and result using resb to allocate the correct amount of bytes (previously incorrectly noted as bits).
Correct initialization and use of string prompts, ensuring null termination and correct length calculation.
Syscall for File Operations
Syscall usage for file operations (read, write) was updated:

Using 0x01 for write and 0x00 for read with the correct file descriptor (stdout as 1 and stdin as 0).
Adjustments to properly handle user input and output of results using the standard input and output streams.
